AudioLabs lab course is a multi-module lab course conducted at the International Audio Laboratories Erlangen (AudioLabs). The lab has 5 different modules, each corresponding to a specific research area of focus at the AudioLabs.  I wrote the lab material for the module - "Speech Enhancement using Microphone Arrays", and have conducted the lab session every semester since Winter semester 2014.
