Abstract: Informed spatial filters (ISF) aim to capture multiple sound
sources with a desired spatial response while attenuating
the undesired signals. The desired spatial response is an
arbitrary function, based on which directional gains at each
time-frequency instant are computed. In this work, we propose
a method to analyze the obtained spatial response at
the output of the ISF and the influence of direction-of-arrival
(DOA) estimation errors. The proposed method
considers two simultaneously active sound sources, where
one source is kept static at a reference position while the
other source is moved across the DOA space by placing
it at discrete DOA points. For each position of the moving
source, we compute the average directional array gain.
Through analysis with simulated speech signals, we show
that with perfect knowledge of the source DOAs the obtained
spatial response matches the desired one, and also
demonstrate the adverse effects of DOA estimation errors.
