title: "On the Numerical Instability of an LCMV Beamformer for a Uniform Linear Array"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-IEEE-SPL
excerpt: 'The paper presents an analysis of the conditions for numerical instability in
the solution of a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV)
beamformer with multiple directional constraints for a uniform
linear array. An analytic expression is presented to determine
the frequencies (for broadband signals such as speech) where the
inverse term in the solution of the LCMV beamformer does not
exist. Simulation results and power patterns are provided to further
illustrate the problem. In addition, we investigate and discuss
possible solutions to the problem.'
