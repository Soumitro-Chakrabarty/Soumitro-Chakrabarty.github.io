Abstract: A spatial filter, with L linear constraints that are based on instantaneous
narrowband direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates, was recently
proposed to obtain a desired spatial response for at most L
sound sources. In noisy and reverberant environments, it becomes
difficult to get reliable instantaneous DOA estimates and hence obtain
the desired spatial response. In this work, we develop a Bayesian
approach to spatial filtering that is more robust to DOA estimation
errors. The resulting filter is a weighted sum of spatial filters pointed
at a discrete set of DOAs, with the relative contribution of each filter
determined by the posterior distribution of the discrete DOAs given
the microphone signals. In addition, the proposed spatial filter is able
to reduce both reverberation and noise. In this work, the required
diffuse sound power is estimated using the posterior distribution of
the discrete set of DOAs. Simulation results demonstrate the ability
of the proposed filter to achieve strong suppression of the undesired
signal components with small amount of signal distortion, in noisy
and reverberant conditions.
