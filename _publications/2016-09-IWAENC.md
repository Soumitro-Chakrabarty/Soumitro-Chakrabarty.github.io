Abstract: It has been shown that human speakers do not radiate voice sound
uniformly in all directions and that the radiation pattern is frequency
dependent. As a consequence, the quality of the speech signal acquired
by distant microphones depends on the relative orientation of
the head with respect to the microphone. In this paper, a single channel
speech enhancement framework is proposed that incorporates
the head orientation information to compensate for the reduction in
sound energy due to the relative orientation of the speaker with respect
to the microphone, while attenuating the noise. In the proposed
framework, the head orientation at each time instance, which can potentially
be estimated using computer vision techniques, is used to
compute the frequency dependent gain factor that needs to be applied
to compensate for the head orientation. The computed gain
is then incorporated in a single channel filter which simultaneously
suppresses the noise. Based on experimental evaluations, with both
simulated and measured data, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed
system to improve the quality of the acquired speech signal.
