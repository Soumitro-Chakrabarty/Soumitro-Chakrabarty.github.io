Abstract:Acoustic source localization and tracking (ASLT) in reverberant environments
is a challenging task due to the multi-path propagation
of acoustic waves. ASLT is often based on the use of a Kalman
filter or a particle filter, with time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) estimates
used as measurements. In this work, we aim to track nonconcurrent
speakers by applying an extended Kalman filter (EKF)
with probabilistic data association (PDA) that takes into account
multiple measurements simultaneously. By using PDA, the inaccuracy
of the measurements caused by room reflections and noise
is explicitly taken into account. Unlike in typical approaches where
the measurements consist of broadband TDOA estimates, the measurements
in the proposed approach consist of multiple narrowband
direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates obtained from distributed microphone
arrays. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating
PDA and using properly selected narrowband DOA estimates
leads to a better tracking performance, as compared to the standard
EKF with a single narrowband or broadband measurement.
